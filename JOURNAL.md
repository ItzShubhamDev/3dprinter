# Custom 3D Printer

Total Time Spent - 29 hours

- ### Day 1 (28 July, 2025) ( 7 - 8 hrs )
  - **Research**
    - Gathered a brief information of different types of Printers and their working principle (CoreXY, Cartesian, Delta, etc.)
    - Collected data about parts availiabity for each type of build required on local vendors.
    - Decided to make a big (350-400)³ mm³ CoreXY would need to go with 300³ mm³ build volume, due to unavailabity of big heatbeds.
    - Watch a lot of CoreXY build related videos like [TechBuilder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuAN5AzEWCg), [3DJake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMfFirtB1D4), etc.
  - **CAD**
  - **Software**

- ### Day 2 (29 July, 2025) (Journal 1) (6 hrs)
  - **Research**
    - Watched some more tutorials of custom CoreXY builds to learn more about building one.
    - Researched for all the parts needed and available locally.
    - Discussed about it with a friend and decided to go with a 300x300x400 mm³.
  - **CAD**
    - Made a basic structure of the 3D Printer

  - **Software**

- ### Day 2 (29 July, 2025) (Journal 2) (4 hrs)
  - **Research**
    - Calculated the size and quantity of required Aluminium Extrusions.
  - **CAD**
    - Replace the structural blocks with Aluminium 2020 and 2040 Extrusions

  - **Software**

- ### Day 3 (30 July, 2025) (Journal 1) (1 hrs)
  - **Research** 
  - **CAD**
    - Added Stepper Motors, Shafts, Threaded Rods.

- ### Day 3 (30 July, 2025) (Journal 2) (4 hrs)
  - **Research**
    - After adding the stepper motor and threaded rod of 400mm, saw some incorrect measurents of the Aluminium profiles so recalculated the lengths of all profiles.
  - **CAD**
    - Updated the Structure to new lengths of Aluminium Profiles.

    - Couldn't find any step files for rod support, so created one using the below measurements.

- ### Day 3 (30 July, 2025) (Journal 3) (5 hrs)
  - **Research**
    - Read articles and watched different videos on X-Y Plane Movement in CoreXY Printers. Almost every one of them used Linear Rails which were very expensive, so I thought of using V Wheels as I am already using Aluminium Extrusion Profiles.
  - **CAD**
    - Added the previous created rod supports and smooth rods.

    - Created a custom wheel for the one available in local store.

    - Added wheels, created a part to connect the wheels with moving extrusion in between and yes measurements for XY axis are also messed up.
