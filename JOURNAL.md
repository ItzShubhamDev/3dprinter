# Custom 3D Printer

Total Time Spent - 7 hours

- ### Day 1 (28 July, 2025) ( 7 - 8 hrs )
  - **Research**
    - Gathered a brief information of different types of Printers and their working principle (CoreXY, Cartesian, Delta, etc.)
    - Collected data about parts availiabity for each type of build required on local vendors.
    - Decided to make a big (350-400)続 mm続 CoreXY would need to go with 300続 mm続 build volume, due to unavailabity of big heatbeds.
    - Watch a lot of CoreXY build related videos like [TechBuilder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuAN5AzEWCg), [3DJake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMfFirtB1D4), etc.
